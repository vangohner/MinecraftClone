# MinecraftClone
The goal of this project is to make a Minecraft clone from scratch.
I'm expecting the process will be something like this:
Make an application that can be launched
Create a 3d renderer where I can see a cube
Create a way to control the camera and move around the cube
Turn the cube into a chunk like Minecraft
Create multiple chunks
Add player physics
Add generation code
Make chunk loading
Allow block manipulation
