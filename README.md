# MinecraftClone

This project aims to build a Minecraft-like game from scratch in Java. The current version provides a very small starting point:

- Basic world data structures (`BlockType`, `Chunk`, `World`)
- A simple `Player` class
- A console application that initialises a flat chunk and prints a top-down view

This is only the first step toward a full clone. Future work will include rendering, input handling, world generation and more.
