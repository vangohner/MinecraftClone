 # MinecraftClone
 
 This project aims to build a Minecraft-like game from scratch in Java. The current version provides a very small starting point:
 
 - Basic world data structures (`BlockType`, `Chunk`, `World`)
 - A simple `Player` class
-- A console application that initialises a flat chunk and prints a top-down view
+- A Swing window that renders a flat chunk in a minimal isometric view
 
-This is only the first step toward a full clone. Future work will include rendering, input handling, world generation and more.
+## Running
+
+This repository uses the Gradle wrapper. To launch the demo straight from the sources run:
+
+```
+./gradlew run
+```
+
+On Windows use `gradlew.bat run` instead.
+
+To build a runnable JAR execute:
+
+```
+./gradlew jar
+java -jar app/build/libs/app.jar
+```
+
+This is only the first step toward a full clone. Future work will include richer rendering, input handling, world generation and more.
